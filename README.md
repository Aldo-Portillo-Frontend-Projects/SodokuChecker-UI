# Sudoku Checker

## This is an extension on an earlier project

### May of 2022 I was working on an employment assessment and I was tasked with creating a sudoku checker using nested loops. I did not have to build a UI for it, but I was looking at React interview prep questions, and I thought this would be a good opportunity to create a UI for some old code

### I got to practice Javascript fundamentals again such as Array.prototype methods and proper state management in React
